## Create a GitHub account:
- Go to GitHub and create an account if you don’t already have one.   
- If you’re creating a new account, you’ll go through a few steps and then see something like Figure 1. There’s no need to do anything here, but notice the box at the bottom that says, “Introduce yourself with a profile README.” You’re welcome to click the “Create” button and edit the file to say more about yourself.

## Fork the assignment repo
Go [here](https://github.com/bsmith-classroom/GitHub-and-Jupyter-setup.git) to access the GitHub repo for your first Jupyter Notebook assignment. Follow the instructions in the [Tool Assignment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16imAtemYNYIN9DfgCvOc7bHflKjIAAGqrh9mAES59KA/edit) document to **fork** the repo.

## Load the Notebook into Google Colab
Go to [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). Use the File menu and "Open notebook" to show the GiHub option. Click that to enter the name of your GitHub repo. Then work through the Notebook.

## Commit your changes to GitHub
When you finish the Notebook, choose "File" and "Save a copy to GitHub." Enter the name of your repo is it's not already on the dialog box. Add a meaningful commit message and click OK.

## Submit the URL to your GitHub repo
On the assignment page in Canvas, go to the Website URL tab. Submit the URL of your GitHub repo there. Remember that URL will look something like this:

https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_ID_HERE/GitHub-and-Jupyter-setup
