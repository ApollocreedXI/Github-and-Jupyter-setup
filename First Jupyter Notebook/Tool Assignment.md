## Create a GitHub account:
- Go to GitHub and create an account if you don’t already have one.   
- If you’re creating a new account, you’ll go through a few steps and then see something like Figure 1. There’s no need to do anything here, but notice the box at the bottom that says, “Introduce yourself with a profile README.” You’re welcome to click the “Create” button and edit the file to say more about yourself.
